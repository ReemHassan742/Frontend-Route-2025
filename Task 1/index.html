        <hr>
        <h3 style="text-align: center; color:aliceblue">Claude Monet was in almost every sense the founder of French Impressionist painting, the term itself coming from one of his paintings, Impression, Sunrise.</h3>

                <td><p style="color: aliceblue;">-Monet's technique of “en plein air” painting was hard at work on this painting. Because it necessitated that he work from the same point of view as he painted, he dug a trench for the bottom half of the painting to sit in while he painted the top, due to its large size (it measures 100 by 81 inches). His model for the women of the painting was Camille Doncieux, who would later become his wife, bearing him two sons. To finish the dresses in the most fashionable style, Monet used magazine illustrations to render the clothing.</p></td>

                <td><p style="color: aliceblue;">-When Impression, Sunrise hung at its first exhibition in 1874, art critic Louis Leroy derisively used the term “Impressionistic,” from the title of this painting, to describe Monet’s works. This term was quickly adopted by what were soon to be known as the Impressionist painters, and the exhibition which included other works by Impressionist artists, was from then on referred to as the “Impressionist Exhibition.” This painting was later stolen in 1985 from the Musee Marmottan Monet in Paris, but was recovered undamaged in 1990, and was put back on display at the museum in 1991.</p></td>

He included the Château Michelet and other recognizable architectural landmarks. The small, delicate brushstrokes identify this work as belonging to the “high” phase of Impressionism. The brilliant colors of Monet’s landscape are mirrored in the water below, resulting in a remarkable symmetry that makes it difficult to distinguish between the reflections and their sources.</p></td>

He began the paintings at the end of the summer of 1890, and continued until the next springs, using the harvests near his home in Giverny, France. Because of the repetitious subject matter, in this series Monet was not as concerned about the haystacks themselves as he was depicting the differences in light and color surrounding the haystacks in the different seasons, time of day, and weather. The paintings are now held in galleries, museums, and private collections around the world, and are some of his most notable works.</p></td>

Today, Claude Monet is primarily known as a landscape painter, but in the beginning of his artistic career, he used to concentrate on portraits. No one else appeares in Monet's paintings as often as Camille. In those year, portraits of women were mostly ordered by bourgeois clients, but among progressive painters, the artistic structure became more important than the identity of the portrayed person. The masterly style, the lack of details, and the plainness of the colours led to a completely new directness of expression, independent of the facial gestures of the depicted person. </p></td>

At the suggestion of the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, the artist visited Antibes on the Mediterranean Sea from January to April 1888. During the 1880s Monet increasingly explored areas beyond Paris and Normandy in search of fresh, appealing motifs. Sometimes these ventures into new territory were accompanied by doubts and challenges, as in the south, where the brilliant sun troubled Monet. </p></td>
